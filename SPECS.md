# Metroidvania Compendium design doc

The following document is the basis for the creation of a website called Metroidvania Compendium. The requirements may change as time goes on but this is what will be used to start the project.

## Introduction

**Metroidvania Compendium** is a website that lists metroidvania games along with a description, screenshots and information about powerups, abilities and other game mechanics that are catalogued and grouped.

The existing [Metroidvania Compendium](https://evidentlycube.github.io/metroidvania-compendium/) will be used as a baseline

The following features will be implemented:

1. Listing of all games in the compendium
2. Listing of all ability categories in the compendium
3. Listing of all abilities in the compendium
4. Editing any of the above
5. API backend to power it all
